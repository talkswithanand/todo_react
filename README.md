# Description
This is a basic React to-do list app with four components: AppName, AddTodo, ToDoItems, and WelcomeMessage. It uses the useState hook to manage the to-do items state, with functions to add and delete items. The app renders these components conditionally, displaying a welcome message when there are no to-do items. The app also includes icons for adding and deleting to-do items, making it more user-friendly.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
